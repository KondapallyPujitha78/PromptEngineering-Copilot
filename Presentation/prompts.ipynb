      "\n",
      "The waiter is like a middleman between you (the customer) and the kitchen (where all the food magic happens). They help translate what you want into something that the kitchen can understand, and they make sure everything gets delivered back to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "A REST API (or \"REST\" for short) works in a similar way. It's like an invisible waiter that helps computers talk to each other over the internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you use a web app or website, it sends requests to the API saying things like: \"Hey, I want this user data!\" or \"Can you update my account settings?\". The API then takes care of getting the information from its own \"kitchen\" (the database) and sending it back to the requesting computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like how the waiter doesn't make your burger for you, but helps the kitchen prepare it, a REST API doesn't do the actual work of processing data or updating databases. It just helps different parts of the system communicate with each other in a standardized way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key features that make a REST API work:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Resources**: These are like the menu items at the restaurant ‚Äì they're what you want to access or manipulate.\n",
      "*   **Endpoints**: Think of these as specific tables where orders get placed. You tell the waiter which table to leave your order at, and that's how it gets to the right place.\n",
      "*   **HTTP methods**: These are like special commands the waiter uses when taking your order. For example, you might ask for a \"GET\" (to retrieve something), an \"UPDATE\", or a \"DELETE\" (to remove something).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, there you have it! A REST API is like an invisible waiter that helps different computers communicate with each other over the internet by translating requests and sending information between systems.\n",

      "Now, imagine if all the restaurants in town had their own unique way of taking orders... some wanted a phone call, others preferred email, and some liked to use messengers. It would be chaos!

    "INSTRUCTION:\n",
    "Write a Python function that validates whether an email address is in a correct format.\n",
    "\n",
    "STEPS:\n",
    "1. Define a function named `is_valid_email`.\n",
    "2. Use Python's `re` (regular expressions) module to check if the email is valid.\n",

    "- Only use standard Python libraries (no external dependencies).\n",
    "- Keep the function concise (‚â§ 10 lines).\n",
